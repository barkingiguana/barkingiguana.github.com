Problems
* Large project
* Slow test

Try: Multiple Apps.
Problems: roll-out. Versions need to match.
Code-duplication - solve by sharing plugins (on texperts site somewhere)
Deployment. Capistrano.
Communication.
  Server-side: REST.
  Client-side: UI / JS framework.

Integrated UI. gives one URI, one login, one window, appears as single tool. Problem: client-side communication inefficient, Single Origin Policy (js / cookies).

Rewrite /(.+)(/.*)$ -> $1.domain.com$2

Single portal app which other apps insert themselves into via widgets. Widgets loaded via Ajax - load time all on client side, nice feedback for user. App doesn't have fixed size (real-estate) on portal page - can choose different sized. JS UI composes and enacts the services on backend apps.

[ svc1 (Rails) ] --\
[ svc2 (Rails) ] ------ [ portal ] ---- [ Foo Widget (JS) ].

Services need not be Rails - as long as can talk REST. Thinking PipsCache, /music, /programmes, BBC User login thingy.
