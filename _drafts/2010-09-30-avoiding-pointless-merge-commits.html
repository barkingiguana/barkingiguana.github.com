Merge branch 'development' of github.com:craigw/whatever into development

Caused by Git automatically merging your changes with upstream changes on pull. Not a very nice commit message, adds almost no value, totally not needed. Do this:

1. Check out tracking branch
2. Create & check out local branch from this.
3. Hack hack hack.
4. Check out tracking branch
5. Pull from remote
6. Rebase local branch onto tracking branch
7. Merge local branch into tracking branch
8. Push to remote
