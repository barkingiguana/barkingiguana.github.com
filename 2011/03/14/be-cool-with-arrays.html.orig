<p>Some of my pet peeves of center around arrays. Ruby provides a really rich language around arrays, use it to make your code more readable.</p>

<p>Ask an array if it's empty. Don't check if it has a size equal to zero.</p>
<pre><code class="ruby">bookmarks.size == 0 # no!
bookmarks.empty? # yes</code></pre>

<p>Ask an array it it has any elements. Don't check if it has a non-zero size.</p>
<pre><code class="ruby">bookmarks.size > 0 # no!
bookmarks.any? # yes</code></pre>

<p>You don't need to ask if an array has elements before iterating over it using each, each will not yield unless the array has elements.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">if bookmarks.any?; bookmarks.each { ... }; end # pointless
bookmarks.each { ... } # does the same thing</code></pre>

I'm sure you have other similar peeves. Let me know what they are in the comments.
