<h2>My key-signing policy</h2>

<p>My key signing policy is pretty simple: if I am convinced that you are who you claim you are, I will sign your key. You can convince me by showing me some form of offical ID that includes your photograph, a drivers licence or passport for example. I will need to meet you in person so I can decide if the ID you present belongs to you. There's a pretty easy to follow walk-through of the process at <a href="http://barkingiguana.com/2011/07/10/reposted-ten-steps-for-attending-a-keysigning-party/">http://barkingiguana.com/2011/07/10/reposted-ten-steps-for-attending-a-keysigning-party/</a>.</p>
