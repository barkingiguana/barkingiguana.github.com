title: "Working with Ruby Arrays: Map with Index"

A simple method that I'm finding I use a fair amount these days is <code>map_with_index</code>. It works the same way as <code>each_with_index</code> except with the behaviour of <code>map</code>, ie every element of the resulting array is what's returned by the block when the element is yielded to it.

<pre><code>module BarkingIguana
  module ArrayExt
    def map_with_index &block
      index = 0
      map do |element|
        result = yield element, index
        index += 1
        result
      end
    end
  end
end

Array.class_eval do
  include BarkingIguana::ArrayExt
end</code></pre>

Great for situations where eg the first N elements of an array have to be slightly different from the rest of the elements:

<pre><code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map_with_index do |element, index|
  model = Model.new element
  model.unlock if index < 3
end</code></pre>
