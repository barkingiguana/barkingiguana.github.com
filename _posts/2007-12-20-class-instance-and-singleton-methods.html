<p>There are three types of methods in Ruby and I always get them confused. Here, for my future reference, is what I currently think they mean.</p>

<h4>Class methods</h4>
<p>Methods which can be called directly on a class.</p>
<pre><code class="ruby">Time.now
Monkey.find(:all)</code></pre>

<h4>Instance methods</h4>
<p>Methods which can be called on <em>any</em> instance of that class.</p>
<pre><code class="ruby">@widget.to_s
Time.now.to_f
</code></pre>

<h4>Singleton methods</h4>
<p>Methods which can be called only on a <em>specific</em> instance of that class.</p>
<pre><code class="ruby">chicken = Chicken.new
class << chicken
  def hide
    # ...
  end
end
chicken.hide</pre></code>
