<p>Tonight I'm giving a talk to the <a href="http://javascript.meetup.com/3/calendar/12285246/">London Javascript User Group</a> where I'm introducing <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>.</p>

<p>My slides are available here: <a href="http://barkingiguana.com/~craig/talks/2010/javascript-london/getting-started-with-node-js">http://barkingiguana.com/~craig/talks/2010/javascript-london/getting-started-with-node-js</a>. There's a script if you print it out or there's a <a href="http://vimeo.com/9125286">video</a> on Vimeo if you'd like to watch it.</p>

<p>If you have any feedback please feel free to leave a comment.</p>
