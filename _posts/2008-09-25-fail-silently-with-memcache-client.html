title: "Fail Silently with Memcache Client"

<p>For web applications <a href="http://www.ukgeocachers.co.uk/catalog/cache-king-44mm-button-badge-p-391.html">caching is king</a> and I've recently been playing with <a href="http://danga.com/memcached/">memcached</a> to cache the results of expensive queries in a Rails application. As a client I've chosen Seattle RB's <a href="http://seattlerb.rubyforge.org/memcache-client/">memcache-client</a>.</p>

<p>The memcache-client library is rather lovely, but it does seem to have the opinion that if a memcached instance fails it should throw an exception which your code has to deal with. I don't agree with that: when a cache fails <em>it doesn't matter</em>. Either the application can continue running in an uncached mode - slow, but possible - or there are other memcache instances that can be used. Switching to either of these should require no special effort in code that uses the library.</p>

<p>Ruby, being awesome, lets me change the behaviour of the client library very easily. Monkey patching may be frowned upon, but it does have a use.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby"># A simple monkey-patch of MemCache so that broken memcached instances don't 
# cause fatal errors in the application. Performance may be severaly degraded
# but it should be possible to use the app anyway!
# 
# A typical use would look something like:
# 
#   result = if cache.alive?
#     fetch = cache.get(:foo)
#     if !fetch
#       fetch = calculate(:foo)
#       cache.set(:foo, fetch)
#     end
#     fetch
#   else
#     calculate(:foo)
#   end
# 
class MemCache
  # Does the cache configuration contain any memcached instances that can 
  # currently be used?

  def alive?
    !!cache.servers.detect{ |s| s.alive? }
  end

  # Rescue from MemCache::MemCacheError -- we want the cache to fail silently
  # (at least from the point of view of the application - you should still
  # monitor memcached).
  # 
  def get_with_rescue(*args)
    get_without_rescue(*args)
  rescue MemCache::MemCacheError
  end
  alias_method :get_without_rescue, :get
  alias_method :get, :get_with_rescue
  alias_method :[], :get
  
  # Rescue from MemCache::MemCacheError -- we want the cache to fail silently
  # (at least from the point of view of the application - you should still
  # monitor memcached).
  # 
  def set_with_rescue(*args)
    set_without_rescue(*args)
  rescue MemCache::MemCacheError
  end
  alias_method :set_without_rescue, :set
  alias_method :set, :set_with_rescue
  alias_method :[]=, :set
  alias_method :add, :set

  # Rescue from MemCache::MemCacheError -- we want the cache to fail silently
  # (at least from the point of view of the application - you should still
  # monitor memcached).
  # 
  def delete_with_rescue(*args)
    delete_without_rescue(*args)
  rescue MemCache::MemCacheError
  end
  alias_method :delete_without_rescue, :delete
  alias_method :delete, :delete_with_rescue
