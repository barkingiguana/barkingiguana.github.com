<p><a href="http://github.com/starling/starling">Starling</a> is a persistent, lightweight work queue implemented in Ruby which talks the memcache protocol. I've recently started playing with it because I don't have the resource to look after, or the requirement for, a full blown service bus. Starling is easier to install and configure than ActiveMQ, but it's nowhere near as fully featured. Both have their place but a discussion of when and where to use them is outside the scope of this article.</p>

<p>I knew that I wanted to use a message bus to turn synchronous requests into asynchronous requests, pushing work off to some background process somewhere. What I didn't know was the form that the message bus would take. If you're familiar with the Gang of Four patterns book you've probably picked out the pattern that I should use here, but to be honest I'm buggered if I know what it's called. <a href="http://github.com/seanohalpin/smqueue">SMQueue</a> which I'm <a href="http://barkingiguana.com/2009/01/01/writing-rubystomp-clients-with-smqueue">familiar with</a> provides a nice abstraction that makes it easy to swap out the message bus implementation while the code remains identical. Lovely, but SMQueue doesn't come with an adaptor for Starling.</p>

<p>"How hard," thought I, "would it be to implement a Starling adapter for SMQueue?"</p>

<p>I blinked and suddenly it existed. Awesome.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">require 'rubygems'
require 'smqueue'
require 'starling'
require 'yaml'

module BarkingIguana
  module Messaging
    module SMQueue
      class StarlingAdapter < ::SMQueue::Adapter
        class Configuration < ::SMQueue::AdapterConfiguration
          DEFAULT_SERVER = '127.0.0.1:22122'

          has :queue
          has :server, :default => DEFAULT_SERVER
        end

        def initialize(*args)
          super
          options = args.first
          @configuration = options[:configuration]
          @configuration[:server] ||= Configuration::DEFAULT_SERVER

          @client = ::Starling.new(@configuration[:server])
        end

        def put(*args, &block)
          @client.set @configuration[:queue], args[0].to_yaml
        end

        def get(*args, &block)
          if block_given?
            loop do
              yield next_message
            end
          else
            next_message
          end
        end

        private
        def next_message
          ::SMQueue::Message(:headers => {},
            :body => YAML.load(@client.get(@configuration[:queue])))
        end
      end
    end
  end
end</code></pre>

<p>Want to use it? You'll need Starling  
running somewhere. After that you can implement a producer in two lines of code:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">producer = SMQueue(:adapter =&gt; BarkingIguana::Messaging::SMQueue::StarlingAdapter, :queue =&gt; "some.queue.name")
producer.put "Quack quack"
</code></pre>

<p>On the  
other side of the connection, here's a sample consumer:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">consumer = SMQueue(:adapter =&gt; BarkingIguana::Messaging::SMQueue::StarlingAdapter, :queue =&gt; "some.queue.name")
consumer.get do |message|
  puts message.body.inspect
  # =&gt; "Quack quack"
end</code></pre>

<p>One thing that's different about this adapter compared to the current SMQueue adapters is that it assumes you want to use YAML as a transport format. I'd prefer to use XML or JSON but it is at the moment just a preference, YAML is the easiest to implement, and I'm lazy.</p>

<p>There's also a bunch of work to do around failover - this adapter only supports one server. I still don't know enough about how Starling would handle failover so I don't want to rush into implementing that and discover I've done it wrong.</p>

<p>If you can help by providing patches for either other transport formats or failover please do.</p>
