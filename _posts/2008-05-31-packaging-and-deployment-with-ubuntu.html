<p>After extensively customising some software on one of our hosts I decided that instead of repeating the procedure another 20 times I'd package the customisations and install that package onto the appropriate hosts. Only one problem: I had no idea how to create Ubuntu packages or distribute them.</p>

<p>After several hours gathering information from a lot of sources that never seem to tell you quite enough to get your software packaged and deployable I've pulled together two articles. Hopefully they'll be helpful to others. Oh, and please do feel free to correct my mistakes - that's the philosophy behind a Wiki after all.</p>
