<p>The very first server we ever commissioned was today taken out of the data-center and retired. kiwi.xeriom.net (or marmaduke.xeriom.net as it was known before 2005) provided three years of brilliant service, first as a shared hosting node and later as a log server. I personally spent hours playing with the box, trying to get everything just so and it was a great bit of kit.</p>

<p>Thank you little dude. It's been a blast.</p>
