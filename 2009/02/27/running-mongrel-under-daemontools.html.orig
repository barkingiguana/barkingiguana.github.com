<p>I've installed <a href="http://barkingiguana.com/2008/11/28/running-daemontools-under-ubuntu-810">DaemonTools</a> to make sure that the various services I run are up and behaving reasonably nicely. Since I also run plenty of Rails applications I use this DaemonTools script to keep Mongrel running.</p>

<pre><code class="bash">#!/bin/sh
exec 2>&1

echo "Starting..."

ENVIRONMENT=production
PORT=8000
IP=0.0.0.0

CHDIR=/var/www/www.application.com
USER=application_user

exec softlimit -m 134217728 \
     setuidgid $USER \
     env HOME=$CHDIR \
     mongrel_rails start -e $ENVIRONMENT -p $PORT -a $IP -c $CHDIR 2&gt;&amp;1</code></pre>

<p>Create a separate service for each Mongrel you'd like to run and change the PORT variable in the script.</p>
