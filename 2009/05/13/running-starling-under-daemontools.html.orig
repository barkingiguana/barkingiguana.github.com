<p>I've been playing with Starling quite a bit recently. Like most of my deployed tools, I like to be sure that it's running. Here's a run script for Starling under DeamonTools:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">#!/bin/sh
# This is /home/starling/service/run

exec 2&gt;&amp;1

echo "Starting..."

PORT=22122
IP=0.0.0.0
USER=starling
HOME=/home/starling

exec setuidgid $USER \
     starling -v -v -v -h $IP -p $PORT -P $HOME/starling.pid -q $HOME/queue 2&gt;&amp;1</code></pre>

<p>You'll want to keep the logs too. Here's the log/run script:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">#!/bin/sh
# This is /home/starling/service/log/run

exec multilog t s1000000 n10 ./main</code></pre>

<p>Note that you'll have to create the starling user to use these scripts (or just change the scripts).</p>
