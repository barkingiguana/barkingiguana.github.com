## My key

If you need to communicate with me securely please use my PGP public key to encrypt the message.

If you think that it is important that I can verify who you are, do not forget to sign the message.

My key can be found at [http://barkingiguana.com/~craig/key.asc](http://barkingiguana.com/~craig/key.asc). It is also available on many public keyservers.

## My key-signing policy

My key signing policy is pretty simple: if I am convinced that you are who you claim you are, I will sign your key. You can convince me by showing me some form of offical ID that includes your photograph, a drivers licence or passport for example. I will need to meet you in person so I can decide if the ID you present belongs to you. There's a pretty easy to follow walk-through of the process at [http://barkingiguana.com/2011/07/10/reposted-ten-steps-for-attending-a-keysigning-party/](http://barkingiguana.com/2011/07/10/reposted-ten-steps-for-attending-a-keysigning-party/).
