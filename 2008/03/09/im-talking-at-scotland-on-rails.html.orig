<p>For three days (03 April to 05 April 2008) Scotland on Rails will host a ton of <a href="http://scotlandonrails.com/speakers">cool speakers</a> covering a massive array of <a href="http://scotlandonrails.com/talks">interesting subjects</a>.</p>

<p>I'm talking at the <a href="http://www.scotlandonrails.com/tutorial">charity tutorial day</a> introducing Rails for those that are not already familiar with it. I'll be covering some best-practice techniques in the talk so even if you already know Rails, come join in, spread the love.</p>

<p>There's still time to <a href="http://scotlandonrails.com/register">register</a> though places are limited so be quick!</p>
