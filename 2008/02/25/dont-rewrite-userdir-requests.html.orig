<p>I have a site that's a Rails application which I also want to be able to use as my home on the web -- a place I keep the stuff that I want to share. Since I use Apache, the simplest way to do this is to use the UserDir module. Unfortunately, the way that I setup my applications catches all requests using mod_rewrite and, after some processing to make sure there's not a cached file to use, passes the request to an application server.</p>

<p>For my future reference, here's the necessary mod_rewrite voodoo to avoid rewriting UserDir requests.</p>

<pre><code># Don't rewrite UserDir requests
RewriteRule ^/~.*$ - [L]
</code></pre>
