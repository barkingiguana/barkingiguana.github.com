<p>A lot of languages encourage talking to yourself. Lots of OO PHP code is sprinkled with code that looks like <code class="php">$this-&gt;foo_method();</code>. In some languages it's necessary. Ruby isn't one of them.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class Foo
  def bar
    # Why are you talking to yourself?!
    @thingy = self.foo
  end

  def foo
    "QUUX!"
  end
end</code></pre>

<p>The code above could be written without <code class="ruby">self</code> at all.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class Foo
  def bar
    @thingy = foo
  end

  def foo
    "QUUX!"
  end
end</code></pre>

<p>While this is a (very) trivial example, it makes a huge difference on larger code-bases. Give it a try: if you don't talk to yourself your code will look less crazy.</p>

<p>Only one caveat: when you're doing assignment you'll need to talk to yourself unless you're doing a local assignment.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class Foo
  attr_accessor :thingy

  def bar
    # This will assign to a local variable.
    thingy = foo
  end

  def foo
    "QUUX!"
  end
end</code></pre>

<pre><code class="ruby">class Foo
  attr_accessor :thingy

  def bar
    # This will call Foo#thingy=
    self.thingy = foo
  end

  def foo
    "QUUX!"
  end
end</code></pre>
