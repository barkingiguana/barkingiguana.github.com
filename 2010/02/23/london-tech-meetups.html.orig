<p>It can be quite hard to find groups in your area that share your interest, and even if you find out that they exist it can be pretty hard to work out when the next meetup is. Some of the meetup groups have frankly <em>mental</em> scheduling rules.</p>

<p><a href="http://johnstewartsutherland.com/">John Sutherland</a> has solved this problem for <a href="http://edinburgh2.com/">Edinburgh tech community meetups</a> by listing when various groups meet and who they'd be of interest to. After asking and receiving permission I've duplicated this idea for <a href="http://london2.org/">London tech community meetups</a>.</p>

<p>If your meetup isn't listed and you'd like it to be, email me at <a href="mailto:craig@barkingiguana.com">craig@barkingiguana.com</a> and let me know.</p>
